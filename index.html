        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Memory card game is widely known game that consists of finding equal pairs of cards that match each other and continuing to do so until there are no more
            cards left on the board.</h5>
  
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Test your memory with this memory game. First select the difficulty level.
             The higher the number, the more cards are in the memory game. On the game board, there are always 
             two identical sounds that relate to each card match. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has 
             the same sound or match as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with 
             the face down and you will need to select another two cards.you are only forgiven for the first ten attempts, after that, your next 
             failure will result in a loss and you will need to try again. Try to remember these sounds as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play.
              When you find a pair they are removed from the board and when you find all the pairs on the board,
               you have completed the level.This game was created with accessbility in mind. That meaning 
               that all major well known screen readers will be fully accessible throughout all different
               pages/stages of the website. There are also other ubqiutious forms of Asistive technology that are also applicable to
               this website.</h5>

          There are two different game modes each with two different levels of difficulty: Sound vs sound will mean that two cards will have identical Sounds
          that relate to the sound of an animal.Sound vs Word  will have the sound an animal makes and its corresponding card will say the name of the card.
          for example, the sound of a cat, so the "meow" will match with a card says the word "cat". If you win the game, your top 5 scores will be saved and presented to you
          
          after you win. the levels of difficulty for each game mode vary from  12 cards and 16 cards. Every time the game is reset, the cards will automatically shuffle.
          Just below there are different sound that demonstrate what each sound means.
